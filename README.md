# LastChance-Launcher

A simple launcher to deliver RAGEMP clientfiles to our players.

Basically it checks for the newest version of our clientfiles. If there is a newer version, it replaces the old clientfiles with freshly downloaded ones.
The launcher is also capable of updating itself.

Feel free to use it for your servers and modify it so it fits your needs. Also make sure to change the version url and the client_resources directory inside Launcher.cs.
